# Semantic Domain Consolidation Mapping

**From 82 domains to 12 core domains**

This document maps all existing semantic domains to the new consolidated set for the Onomastics database.

## Proposed 12 Core Semantic Domains

1. **Historical** - Leaders, rulers, political figures, reformers
2. **Military** - Warriors, generals, strategic leaders, martial aspects  
3. **Mythological** - Legendary figures, deities, titans, divine beings
4. **Philosophical** - Thinkers, scholars, intellectual pursuits
5. **Literary** - Poets, writers, orators, artistic achievements
6. **Geographic** - Place-based names, ethnic origins, locations
7. **Physical** - Appearance, bodily characteristics, physical traits
8. **Familial** - Family relationships, lineage, ancestry
9. **Virtue** - Character traits, moral qualities, honors
10. **Religious** - Spiritual aspects, priestly functions, sacred elements
11. **Political** - Governance, civic roles, democratic ideals
12. **Personal** - Individual identity, birth circumstances, personal names

## SQL Update Script

To apply these consolidations to an existing database, use the following SQL commands:

```sql
-- Consolidate to Historical
UPDATE CanonicalNames SET semantic_domain = 'Historical' WHERE semantic_domain IN (
    'Academic', 'Aristocratic', 'Democratic', 'Dynasty', 'Dynastic', 'Economic', 
    'Golden', 'Imperial', 'Leadership', 'Legal', 'Royalty', 'Scholarly', 
    'Succession', 'Tyrannical', 'Conquest', 'Foundational', 'Resilient', 
    'Resistance', 'Steadfast', 'Diplomatic', 'Order', 'Patrician', 
    'Ceremonial', 'Commerce', 'Precious', 'Temporal', 'Wise', 'Liberation', 
    'Fraternal', 'Generous'
);

-- Consolidate to Military
UPDATE CanonicalNames SET semantic_domain = 'Military' WHERE semantic_domain IN (
    'War', 'Heroic', 'Equestrian', 'Maritime', 'Strength', 'Cunning', 
    'Tragic', 'Romantic', 'Beauty', 'Legendary', 'Honorific'
);

-- Consolidate to Mythological
UPDATE CanonicalNames SET semantic_domain = 'Mythological' WHERE semantic_domain IN (
    'Mythology', 'Titan', 'Divine', 'Magical', 'Concealment', 'Mystical', 
    'Fortune', 'Astronomical'
);

-- Consolidate to Philosophical
UPDATE CanonicalNames SET semantic_domain = 'Philosophical' WHERE semantic_domain IN (
    'Intellectual', 'Ethical', 'Atomic', 'Mathematical', 'Medical', 'Longevity'
);

-- Consolidate to Literary
UPDATE CanonicalNames SET semantic_domain = 'Literary' WHERE semantic_domain IN (
    'Comic', 'Floral', 'Light'
